What are realistic work flows ( ✨ User Stories ✨ )

## Play with the Data

1. Import a single CSV file
1. Do some sorting, filtering, etc. for whatever purpose
1. Possibly export a CSV with said data

## Try to Find Patterns

1. Import a single data source
1. Run some statistical analyses on some of the fields
1. View correlations or whatever

## Augment a Data Source

1. Import some data
1. Search for other data that might be joined with it
1. Join the data, then export the result

# Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Importing data from CSV or IRI
	- This isn't going to be something users will care about much once they have their data locked in
	- A modal might do for "advanced" source management (except sharing)
- Seeing the data in a table

# Misc

1. Does making a chart really deserve a tab?
1. Tabs seem to be geared toward high level tasks. Charts might be for exploration OR for sharing.
