# Data Prism

Data Prism is a library for dealing with structured graphs. These can be databases, APIs, caches, or anything else that fits these criteria:

- The data can be described by a schema of resources
- Resources have properties as well as relationships to other resources

## Components

### Store

A store is a repository of data that follows a schema that is provided to it.

### Schema

A schema describes the data within a store.
